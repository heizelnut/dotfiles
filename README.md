# dotto files
To use them, bleed your fingers and copy-paste files by hand. Literally, I cannot find a minimal tool to do it, maybe I'll write one in POSIX shell.

## Pimp my GAHNOO/Linux, what's on there?

 - [xinit](.xinitrc) config to start all the daemons and dwm
 - [zsh](.zshrc) config with some environment variables and PS1 prompt
 - [scripts](.local/scripts) with eventually some [assets](.local/assets) for my status bar and zsh plugins
 - [config files](.config) for all the other stuff
