dotto files
===========
to use them, bleed your fingers and copy-paste files by hand.

what's on there?
 + .xinitrc config to start all the daemons and dwm
 + .zshrc config with some environment variables (.zshenv) and PS1 prompt
 + scripts with eventually some assets (.local/assets) for my status bar
 + .config files for all the other stuff
